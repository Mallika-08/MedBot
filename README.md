# MedBot
✨ #Origin ✨

MediBot.AI was conceived from our profound sense of altruism toward the well-being of individuals within our community. Our foremost aim was to establish a platform that serves the needs of individuals reliant on regular medication intake and routine medical check-ups. Recognizing the prevalent propensity to overlook minor details amidst contemporary work demands, we embarked on this endeavour.

🤖 #Functionality 🌟

MediBot.AI prompts users to adhere to their medication schedules and advocates for regular medical check-ups. Furthermore, it meticulously monitors essential health indicators such as blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and oxygen saturation. It facilitates the computation of users' annual health statuses and dispatches timely reminders regarding their health conditions via messages. Additionally, this functionality extends to accommodating volunteers who seek to provide regular assistance to individuals, offering avenues for suggesting improvements to their healthy lifestyles.

🔧🛠️ #Development Process 🔧🛠️

In the development process, we utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React Js to enhance user experience and design visually captivating web pages. The integration of frontend and backend components was achieved using Flask and MongoDB. Twilio served as the platform for sending messages to users, while Python was leveraged for developing the chatbot functionality. We also used Fitbit integration to take the data.
